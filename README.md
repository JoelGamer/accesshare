# Accesshare

A project developed for a university class (Engenharia de Software/Software Engenieering III).
The idea of this project is to create a aplication where it is possible to share with other users access to accounts (usualy paid accounts),
and manage the values that each one will pay each month by dividing the value of the account by each user.
